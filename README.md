# blender_auto_ve

A set of scripts to leverage blenders python API for automatic video editing

## Idea

Manually editing videos can be tedious, especially for long footage where most of it is boring. This script automates the editing process by creating a video in which interesting bits are kept and boring intermediat parts are sped up - an alternating time warp so to speak. Besides manually putting markers for transitions, the editing process is fully automatic.
